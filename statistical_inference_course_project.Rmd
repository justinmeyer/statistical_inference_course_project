```

## Overview

This project will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. 

## Simulations

```{r}

# Simulate exponential distribution

exp_dist <- rexp(1000, 0.2)

summary(exp_dist)

```

## Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean

## Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance

## Distribution





This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
